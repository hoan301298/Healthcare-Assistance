# Gambit-Labs

Create Rest API to fetch data from [Gambit-lab challenge](https://github.com/gambit-labs/challenge/tree/master) and parse it to a readable form. Use ReactJS (front-end) and Node.js (back-end).  Authentication by generating JWT.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Execute project

```bash
- React
cd client
npm start

- Node.js
cd server
node server.js
```

## How does it work?
- When front-end and back-end are both working, the site localhost:3000 automatically opened.
- Username: admin / Password: AteaHoanTran
- Data will be shown and checked by authentication JWT token.
